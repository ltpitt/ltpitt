# Hi, my name is Davide Nastri!
Welcome to my GitHub,   

I am currently working as a Backend Developer (Java / Maven / Spring) but I love using any technology.  
In my repos you will find mainly Java / Python / Javascript / BASH / C++ / Go projects and experiments.  

I love automation and GitHub actions, I hope you can find something useful or interesting around here.  
 
Happy hacking :)
